<p>Hello everybody!<br>
<br>
 My name is Gautam Kaul and I am from Witty Iternational School, studying in 8th grade.
One of my favorite things to do in my freetime is to cook food. For the longest time it has been a hobby
and I am eager on showing you some easy recipes and tips on cooking.</p>

<p>Some cuisines that i would like to prepare with you are Chinese, Indian, and American. 
I think that everyone should learn how to properly cook food, as it will also benefit you in the long run. 
The reason I creatd this website is to share some recipes of mine and make cooking easier for you!</p>

<h3><b>BENEFITS OF MAKING FOOD AT HOME</b></h2>

<p style="color:blue">1. Saves money<br></p>
<p>Eating homemade foods is usually much cheaper than eating at a restaurant or buying processed foods from the market.</p><br>
<br>

Plan several days of meals. We’ll be less likely be tempted to eat something else if we have a plan or something already made.
Make a grocery list and stick to it to avoid buying extra food.
Save leftovers in the refrigerator or freezer. Once you get a stock of leftovers stored, you can reheat them at a later date when you don’t have time to cook.<br>
<br>
<p style="color:blue">2. Saves time<br></p>
It might seem like grabbing something to eat at the local supermarket or driving to get take-out at the
closest restaurant might be a quick solution when you’re in a hurry. In reality, many times it can be much faster to cook something at home,
especially when you plan ahead. There are so many meals that can be made in less than 30 minutes. And if you choose a more complex recipe, 
you can always cook in bulk and eat the surplus later in the week or freeze it.<br>
<br>
<p style="color:blue">3. Healthier ingredients<br></p>
Many commercially prepared foods are high in fat, salt, and sugar. When we prepare our own food, 
we know exactly which ingredients and how much of each are going into our food.<br>
<br>

<p style="color:blue">4. Avoid food allergies and sensitivities<br></p>
Preparing your food at home can be especially beneficial if you or a family member has a food allergy. 
Because you are in control in your own kitchen, you can reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.<br>
<br>
<p style="color:blue">5. Portion control<br></p>
Many restaurants and fast food joints offer portions that are much larger than necessary. 
And the problem is, when food is in front of you, chances are you’ll eat it. When you dine in,
you can regulate the amount of food served for dinner, eliminating unnecessary temptation.<br>
<br>
<p style="color:blue">6. Brings family together<br></p>
Eating at home gives the entire family time to talk about their day.<br>
<br>

Involving your children in food preparation (maybe by asking them to read the recipe out loud or mix ingredients) is not only a fun thing to do,
but also a great way to teach them healthy eating habits.
